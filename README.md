Automatune is a procedural editor that allows you to create compositions, with simple but effective controls.

## Components
Below are the simple components through which you can create compositions:

- `Note`: adds a note to a tile in the grid
- `Visitor`: a ball that bounces on the walls, when it meets a note, reproduces it
- `Arrow`: Change the direction of a Visitor

## Save the audio
Through the interface it is possible to record the composition made.

- `Android/IOS`: The audio file is stored in the package installation data folder. You can share the audio after saving it
- `Windows/OSX`: The audio file is stored in the Music/Automatune folder of the operating system.

## Showcase Video
The following video shows the operation of the procedural generator:
